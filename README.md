# Welcome to Mirror Size!

Online fashion stores often find themselves with a common problem: **products return**.

There is no an online trial room in most of the internet e-commerce websites, and a size that can fit you in one brand may be quite different in another.

That's why **Mirror Size** was created! I want to contribute to ideas that can turn into a solution for people, business and the environment!

## How it works:

* Mirror Size is a react-app, you can find the documentation at the end of this README file. 
* It works with the [Tensorflow pose-detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/pose-detection) and the method called is BlazePose.
* In the utilities file you can find auxiliar functions. It also contains the clothes dictionary with the sizes and an array (in cm) with the values (in cm) of width and torso height for t-shirts. You can edit this dictionary with your own values for your products.
* To estimate the "real" size using the webcam, it is stablished in the program that the distance from one hand to another is equal to the height. According to [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-body-ratios/) this ratio is almost 1:1. *It is important to note that the app offers an estimation and not real measurements.*
* If you want to make other products size estimations you would need to create an array of the points of interest using the BlazePose documentation or the model of your preference. Then you would have to edit the comparingDistance file to make that measurement. You can use the Size and iterateSize functions to make the calculations easier.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
